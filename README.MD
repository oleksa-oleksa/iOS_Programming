03. RoadPoints_GPS_FinalApp
An Application using CoreLocation. Simulation done with a  gpx-file for Berlin. There are 6 points on the map with custom tutles and tasks. When a user approaches the some point, he receives a sound notification and a text warning about the task. It is a small application with GPS that could serve as personal adviser for old people and remind them to do some tasks depending on their location in the city.
